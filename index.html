<h1>Automated Door Controller</h1>

<h2 style="font-size: x-large; color: brown;"><i>About our Project...</i></h2>

    <p class="a" style=" margin-bottom: 40px; font-size: 0.8rem;">This Project uses a Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensor and 
        a servo motor to create a simple motion-activated system. The PIR sensor is connected to digital pin 7, and the servo motor is connected to digital pin 8. The program constantly reads the PIR sensor's output. If motion is detected (HIGH signal), the servo motor moves to a 180-degree position, simulating an action like opening a door, and then waits for 3 seconds before resetting. If no motion is detected (LOW signal), the servo motor moves to a -200-degree position, representing a closed or initial state. The Serial monitor is used to display the sensor's output for debugging purposes. This project creates a basic motion-triggered servo system, which could be expanded for various applications such as automated doors or interactive projects.</p>

<p style="color: bisque;">I Worked completely on of the Non-Technical Aspect of this project , which includes construction,maintanance and shaping of physical structure, representation this project. My technical aspect in this project was to examine the core technical part of the project that is Code(Arduino IDE), creating the code that matches the logical aspects of the project.I also made sure the everthing goes well as standard that is expected.</p>

<p style="color: bisque;">I worked on mostly on the Technical aspects by inspecting on the physical structures to withstand the IoT equipments to make in work more effectively.</p>
